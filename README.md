# XTransform 

is a simple and basic gui wrapper for /usr/bin/xsltproc written in swift. It doesn't solve any real problem. Simple steps that can be learned are: 

	- tranform xml files into a new file format with xslt
	- wrap macOS commandline tools in a sandboxed swift app
	- use the the NSOpenPanel and NSSavePanel in a sandboxed app

The included XSL transformation example are inspired by www.w3schools.com


## TODO

    - Documentation
    - Provide example files xml and xslt
    - ...
